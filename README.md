# Intelligent Database Backup & Recovery System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on the design of an intelligent, automated database backup and recovery system using AI for failure prediction, real-time monitoring, and compliance with data regulations like POPIA and HIPAA. The system is designed for hospital or enterprise IT environments.

## âœ… User Stories

| **Story ID** | **User Story** | **Acceptance Criteria** | **Priority** |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| US-001 | As a DBA, I want the system to create backups at predefined intervals so that data is not lost. | Backups must occur every 24 hours and be logged. | High |
| US-002 | As IT support, I want failure prediction so I can fix issues before downtime. | Alerts must occur 24 hours before failure with 95% accuracy. | High |
| US-003 | As IT support, I want the system to restore from backup automatically to minimize downtime. | RTO: 30 mins, RPO: 1 hour. | High |
| US-004 | As a Security Officer, I want anomaly detection for monitoring threats. | Alerts within 5 mins, logs recorded. | High |
| US-005 | As a DBA, I want manual override of recovery to intervene when necessary. | UI interface available for manual control. | Medium |
| US-006 | As a Security Officer, I want encrypted backup and recovery. | AES-256 encryption used. | High |
| US-007 | As a Hospital Manager, I want real-time database health metrics. | Dashboard shows live metrics. | Medium |
| US-008 | As a Compliance Auditor, I want audit logs of backup/recovery. | Logs must be stored for 12 months. | High |
| US-009 | As a Compliance Auditor, I want compliance reports generated. | Reports include consent, retention, and logs. | High |
| US-010 | As an AI System, I want to retrain models to improve predictions. | Models updated every 30 days with 95% accuracy. | Medium |

### Business Rules

- A backup must be created at least every 24 hours.
- Only authorized users can trigger recovery.
- Audit logs must be retained for 12 months.
- AI model must be retrained every 30 days.
- Data backups must be encrypted using AES-256.
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) must not exceed 30 minutes.
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) must not exceed 1 hour.
