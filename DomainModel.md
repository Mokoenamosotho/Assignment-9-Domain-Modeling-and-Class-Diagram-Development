## üìè Business Rules

- **Automated Backups:** A database must be backed up at least once every 24 hours.  
- **Manual Overrides:** Only users with the correct role (e.g., Admin, ITSupport) can override automated recovery.  
- **Encryption:** All backups must use AES-256 encryption if `isEncrypted` is true.  
- **AI Training:** AI models must be retrained every 30 days to maintain prediction accuracy above 95%.  
- **Audit Retention:** Audit logs must be retained and accessible for at least 12 months.  
- **RTO and RPO:** Recovery must meet an RTO of 30 minutes and RPO of 1 hour.
